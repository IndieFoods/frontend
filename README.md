## What is IndieFoods?

IndieFoods is a home-cooked food subscription platform created to empower the indie chefs, the superstars who cook great food at home and want to take it a step higher. Our users will have the choice of multiple meal plans and chefs within their area.

## What's our Motive?

<ul>
<li>
The pandemic saw many indie chefs delivering home cooked food to support the sick but most of it happened in the unorganized sector, like whatsapp groups. 
</li>
<li>
After brief research we couldn’t find a good and active platform for home-cooked food subscriptions. There are players like FoodDarzee but they hire professional chefs and the rates are very expensive. There are a couple of home-cooked food delivery companies but they work on a per-order basis and not subscriptions. They too aren’t very active and their websites either crashed or didn’t accept orders. So we believe there is a good market share to be captured in this segment.
</li>
<li>
Another reason why we built IndieFoods is to empower the indie chefs and hence lead to the growth in the individual creator economy, which is all the buzz these days.
</li>
<li>
And finally, we aim to provide healthy home-cooked food at affordable prices.
</li>
</ul>
